Decensored Photography

A term coined by British writer Joanna Zylinska, it is tightly linked to her research on nonhuman photography. Essentially Zylinska has raised awareness of photography that has no human relation to its subject matter or if there are humans present, it's to a very insignificant position and also is made strictly for the benefit of machines. Such examples can be like satellite imaging for Google Maps or other GPS services, microscopic or telescope images to take detailed snapshots of nature and our world. 

In addition to that concept, Zylinska also stresses the dangers that surveillance and government overreach can have on society. At times, those in power tend to cover up their scandals and skeletons from the eyes of the public. They also prevent laymen and women from exposing the truth. Due to how many people possess phones nowadays, it is very easy for them to take videos and photos of everything that happens around them, the good and the bad. While this accessibility greatly benefits the elites’ economic control on the general population, they also foresaw the threat of uncovering truths that they don't want to leak out. Thus governments have gone through great lengths to censorship.

With Zylinska's research and work, she has raised awareness and brought up tips of decensored photography, how it's possible for everyday folks to take pictures without government interference. She brings up how important it is for folks to participate in this practice in order to prevent authoritarianism from expanding in our society.
